Subject: Assignment for Metrc Skill Test

Dear [Applicant],

We are excited to inform you that have advanced to our next level of our application process for a position at METRC within the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.

We would like you to complete a task to showcase your data analysis skills. This task involves working with our internal package, AnalyticCodebase, and generating visualizations from an existing dataset.

Please clone our repository at this link https://github.com/metrc/AnalyticCodebase_Skills_Test_Harder and set your working directory to the project root. You will find detailed instructions and specific task details within the README.md file in the root directory.

The GitHub PAT you need is [PAT].

This task is designed to test your understanding of the R programming language, data analysis skills, and your ability to interact with our codebase. It's also meant to provide insights into your problem-solving approach and your ability to work independently.

We expect you to refer to the documentation for the AnalyticCodebase package and the Analytic System as you proceed. Remember that asking for advice or clarification is a good practice when the documentation doesn't suffice.

Please submit your solution by pushing your local changes to your own GitHub repository, ensuring you do not commit any data files. Instead, copy the necessary 'weight_bearing_data.feather' file, that was attached to this email, into the 'skills_test/weight bearing-cached_data' folder in your local repository.

Upon completion of your tasks, kindly update the README.md with a description of your process, and then draft a brief email to a hypothetical boss, summarizing your accomplishments.

We trust that you'll employ the necessary tools and resources at your disposal, including ChatGPT. However, it is crucial that no data is shared with it to preserve privacy.

Please also fill out the following Google Form. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePbqpP5LbTYY7oMpZpq8SarOMbdKQJwQ3MXJoAxb5kgI07Dg/viewform?usp=sf_link

We look forward to reviewing your work! Please let us know when we can expect your skills test to be complete and when you plan on starting by email (we understand you may have other responsibilities so feel free to take a week or so if you don't have much free time). You can expect it to only take 2-3 hours once you get the environment set up. If it take more time that is ok, we will not be factoring time into our assessment. (We will only respond to during regular business hours so you may want to factor that into your work flow).

Best regards,
[Your Name]
